### Recording Specifications
Your recording(s) must contain the entire window you use to play Minecraft. You are free to include the following in your recording, if you want to:
- In-game audio
- Other screens/windows that are related to building your creation (e.g., a window with your dataset open, an image of a rough sketch)
- Microphone audio (e.g., if you are thinking of talking out loud as you build)
- Keyboard and/or mouse overlay

Please do not record any video that shows your face or any other part of your body, as this will break the anonymity of the study.

You can save your recordings in any common video file format (e.g., .mp4, .mkv, .mov).
