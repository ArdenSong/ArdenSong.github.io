### Using OBS Studio
OBS Studio is a free, open-source software for video recording and live streaming. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/download) from its website. If you're using OBS Studio, you will be recording your gameplay straight onto your computer. 

### Twitch
Please do not use Twitch to record your gameplay. For this study, we are interested in observing how individual people create things in Minecraft (i.e., without an audience or additional participation). There is no longer an option to create a truly private stream on Twitch, with no chance of anyone joining. 

### Recording Specifications
Your recording(s) must contain the entire window you use to play Minecraft. You are free to include the following in your recording, if you want to:
- In-game audio
- Other screens/windows that are related to building your creation (e.g., a window with your dataset open, an image of a rough sketch)
- Microphone audio (e.g., if you are thinking of talking out loud as you build)
- Keyboard and/or mouse overlay

Please do not record any video that shows your face or any other part of your body, as this will break the anonymity of the study.

You can save your recordings in any common video file format (e.g., .mp4, .mkv, .mov).
