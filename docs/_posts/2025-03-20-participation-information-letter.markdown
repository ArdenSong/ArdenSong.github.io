To help you make an informed decision regarding your participation, this letter will explain what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits, and your rights as a research participant. If you do not understand something in this letter, please ask one of the investigators before agreeing to participate in the study. You may wish to save a copy of this letter for your records.

### What is the study about?
You are invited to participate in a research study about how people use Minecraft to represent data. The purpose of the study is to understand the actions that occur when Minecraft is used to represent data, what the representations look like, and the benefits and challenges of this process. The research is important because it may lead to a better understanding of how people represent data and could be used to develop a Minecraft tool for educational purposes. The study is part of the research for a masterâ€™s thesis.

### What does participation involve?
Participation in the study will consist of:
-	Choosing a dataset
-	Using Minecraft to represent the data from the dataset
-	Screen recording your Minecraft gameplay as you represent the data
-	Explaining what you created 
-	Submitting your recording(s), explanation, and the Minecraft world file containing what you created through an online form

You may take as much time as you need to represent the data, and can do so over multiple sessions, as long as you record all of your gameplay.

### Who may participate in the study?
To participate in the study, you need to be at least 18 years of age and have access to a computer with Minecraft.

### Is participation in the study voluntary?
Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decide to not participate in the study by not submitting your recordings and other files.

### Will I receive anything for participating in the study?
To thank you for your time, you will receive a $20 electronic gift card to [video game platform(s)]. To keep your responses anonymous, you will be asked to input your email address for purposes of receiving the electronic gift card in a separate online questionnaire. Email addresses will be stored separately, then destroyed once electronic gift cards have been issued. The amount received is taxable. It is your responsibility to report this amount for income tax purposes.

### What are the possible benefits of the study?
Participation in this study will not provide any personal benefit to you. Information from this study may contribute to a better understanding of how people represent data and contribute to the creation of a Minecraft educational tool.

### What are the risks associated with the study?
There are no known or anticipated risks associated with participation in this study.

### Will my identity be known?
Your participation in this study, and the data collected, is anonymous. As described above, email addresses will be collected separately for sending gift cards. 

### Can I withdraw from this study?
No. Once you have submitted your information, removing it is not possible because the researchers will have no way of identifying which information is yours.

### Will my information be kept confidential?
The study uses Qualtrics to collect participant submissions. Qualtrics has implemented technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect the information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is ever fully secure or error free. Qualtrics temporarily collects your computer IP address to avoid duplicate responses in the dataset but will not collect information that could identify you personally. Collected data will be securely stored on password-protected computers for at least 7 years. Only members of the research team will have access to the collected data.
