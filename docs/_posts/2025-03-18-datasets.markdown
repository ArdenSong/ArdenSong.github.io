The following table contains average appropriateness ratings of 15 different behaviours (in the leftmost column) in 15 different social situations (in the top row).
This dataset was extracted from a 1974 social psychology study performed on university students.

Appropriateness ratings range from 0 to 9, where 0 means "The behaviour is *extremely inappropriate* in this situation" and 9 means "The behaviour is *extremely appropriate* in this situation".
