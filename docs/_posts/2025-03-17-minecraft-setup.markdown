### Edition and Version
If it is possible, create your visualization in Minecraft: Java Edition. If you do not have access to Java Edition, you may use Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or Minecraft Education instead. Please play on the most recent version of Minecraft for your edition.

### Single-player
Please build your creation in a local, single-player world.  

### Modding
If you are playing a modded version of Minecraft, make sure your world file is openable in vanilla (i.e., unmodded) Minecraft without crashing or losing world data (e.g., no mods with new blocks or mobs). If you are unsure, play in vanilla Minecraft world. 

### Resource Packs
Your Minecraft creation will be viewed by the researchers in Minecraft using the default resource pack. If you are using a different resource pack, be aware that the textures you see when building your creation will not be the same as those that the researchers see when they explore your world. 

### Game Mode
Please play in either Survival or Creative mode (no Hardcore mode).

### World Preset/World Type
You are free to create in any world preset/type (e.g., default/infinite, superflat/flat, amplified, single biome, etc.).
