### Step-by-step instructions

1. Head to the [Datasets post]({% post_url 2025-03-18-datasets %}) and choose a dataset that you want to represent.
2. Test your screen recording system and make sure it works. Check out the [Screen Recording post]({% post_url 2025-03-16-screen-recording %}) for more details.
3. Check your [Minecraft setup]({% post_url 2025-03-17-minecraft-setup %}) to make sure it's compatible with the study. 
4. Start screen recording and building in Minecraft! Represent the data that you chose in a Minecraft world. You are free to use any mechanics/aspects of the game (e.g., blocks, mobs, redstone, potions, command blocks). There is no right or wrong way to use the game, and no right or wrong way to represent the data! You can do your building in one session, or over multiple sessions. Just make sure you record each session. 
5. Once you're done building, make an explanation of what you created, as if you were sharing it with a friend. The format of the explanation is up to you. For example, you could record a "tour" of your creation, narrating or text annotations as you go along. You could take several screenshots of your creation and annotate them with text, perhaps by adding text onto the pictures themselves, or compiling them in a document and adding captions there. Feel free to provide your explanation in whatever format you're comfortable with.
6. Visit the [Submitting Your Creation post]({% post_url 2025-03-15-submitting-your-creation %}) to figure out how to submit your work for the study. You will need your screen recordings, your explanation, and a copy of Minecraft world you built in. At this point, you will also be asked to provide consent for the study. P.S. Make sure you leave your avatar in a location that's near your creation, so if the researchers choose the explore it in-game, they are able to find it!
7. Congratulations! Once you complete your submission, you will be directed to a separate form that will ask you for an email address. We will use that email to send you a gift card as thanks for your participation.
