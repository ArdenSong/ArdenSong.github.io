To submit your creation and consent to participating in this study, visit the following link: [https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAUonbXJntvpP0](https://uwaterloo.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3rAUonbXJntvpP0).

### Consent
To participate in this study, you will need to consent to the following two things:
1. You need to agree to particpate in the study.
2. You need to agree to have your Minecraft gameplay session(s) recorded to be analysed by the research team.

You also have the option to consent to two additional items:
1. You can agree to the use of anonymous quotations from your submission (for example, from your explanation of what you created). These quotations would be used in papers or publications that come from this study.
2. You can agree to the use of images or video that come from your submission (for example, screenshots from your gameplay or Minecraft world). These images or videos would be used in teaching, scientific presentations, or publications.

Consenting to the additional terms does not guarantee that we will use quotations or images/video from your submission. Consenting to the additional terms also does not impact the value of the gift card you will get upon completion of the study. 

### File Upload
You will be asked to upload your video recordings, your explanation, and your Minecraft world file separately. If you have multiple files to upload in any one of these categories (for example, multiple video recordings), please combine them into one ZIP file. If your explanation is part of one of the other two uploads (for example, you explain your creation in one of the video recordings, or your explanation consist of signs placed throughout the Minecraft world), please upload a file explaining where we can find your explanation.
